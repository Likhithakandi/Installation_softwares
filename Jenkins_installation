Jenkins Redhat Packages
To use this repository, run the following command:
  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
  
If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the rpm --import will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.
